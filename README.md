# Activity-Tracker-API
API (NodeJS) for group 3's CS 321 project.
Please install node if you haven't already done so at `https://nodejs.org/en/`. Run `npm start` to start up the server; this allows the UI to make http requests and load up data from either a Database or just locally stored static data from the backend.
